    """
    Computes the cross entropy loss of a sequence, weighted with respect to
    some user provided weights. Note that the weighting here is not the same as
    in the `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` criterion, which is weighting
    classes; here we are weighting the loss contribution from particular elements
    in the sequence. This allows loss computations for models which use padding.

    # Parameters

    logits : `torch.FloatTensor`, required.
        A `torch.FloatTensor` of size (batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)
        which contains the unnormalized probability for each class.
    targets : `torch.LongTensor`, required.
        A `torch.LongTensor` of size (batch, sequence_length) which contains the
        index of the true class for each corresponding step.
    weights : `Union[torch.FloatTensor, torch.BoolTensor]`, required.
        A `torch.FloatTensor` of size (batch, sequence_length)
    average: `str`, optional (default = `"batch"`)
        If "batch", average the loss across the batches. If "token", average
        the loss across each item in the input. If `None`, return a vector
        of losses per batch element.
    label_smoothing : `float`, optional (default = `None`)
        Whether or not to apply label smoothing to the cross-entropy loss.
        For example, with a label smoothing value of 0.2, a 4 class classification
        target would look like `[0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05]` if the 3rd class was
        the correct label.
    gamma : `float`, optional (default = `None`)
        Focal loss[*] focusing parameter `gamma` to reduces the relative loss for
        well-classified examples and put more focus on hard. The greater value
        `gamma` is, the more focus on hard examples.
    alpha : `Union[float, List[float]]`, optional (default = `None`)
        Focal loss[*] weighting factor `alpha` to balance between classes. Can be
        used independently with `gamma`. If a single `float` is provided, it
        is assumed binary case using `alpha` and `1 - alpha` for positive and
        negative respectively. If a list of `float` is provided, with the same
        length as the number of classes, the weights will match the classes.

    # Returns

    `torch.FloatTensor`
        A torch.FloatTensor representing the cross entropy loss.
        If `average=="batch"` or `average=="token"`, the returned loss is a scalar.
        If `average is None`, the returned loss is a vector of shape (batch_size,).
