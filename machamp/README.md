This code base is an extension of the
[AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) library with a focus on
multi-task learning.  It has support for training on multiple datasets for a
variety of standard NLP tasks.  For more information we refer to the paper:
[Massive Choice, Ample Tasks (MACHAMP): A Toolkit for Multi-task Learning in
NLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14672.pdf)

## Installation
To install all necessary packages run:

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
To train the model, you need to write a configuration file. Below we show an
example of such a file for training a model for the English Web Treebank in 
the Universal Dependencies format. 

```
{
    "UD-EWT": {
        "train_data_path": "data/ewt.train",
        "validation_data_path": "data/ewt.dev",
        "word_idx": 1,
        "tasks": {
            "lemma": {
                "task_type": "string2string",
                "column_idx": 2
            },
            "upos": {
                "task_type": "seq",
                "column_idx": 3
            },
            "xpos": {
                "task_type": "seq",
                "column_idx": 4
            },
            "morph": {
                "task_type": "seq",
                "column_idx": 5
            },
            "dependency": {
                "task_type": "dependency",
                "column_idx": 6
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Every dataset needs at least a name (UD-EWT), a `train_data_path`,
`validation_data_path`, and `word_idx`. The `word_idx` tells the model in which
column the input words can be found. 

Every task requires a unique name, a `task_type` and a `column_idx`. The
`task_type` should be one of `seq`, `string2string`, `dependency`, `multi_seq`,
`seq_bio`, `classification`, these are explained in more detail below. The
`column_idx` indicates the column from which the labels of the task should be 
read.

```
python3 train.py --dataset_config configs/ewt.json --device 0
```

You can set `--device -1` to use the cpu. The model will be saved in
`logs/ewt/<date>_<time>` (you can also specify another name for the model with
`--name`).  We have prepared several scripts to download data, and
corresponding configuration files, these can be found in the `configs` and the
`test` directory.

If your data contains column headers, `skip_first_line` can be set to true on 
the dataset level, and the first line of the file will be ignored.

**Warning** We currently do not support the enhanced UD format, where words are
splitted or inserted. The script `scripts/misc/cleanConll.py` can be used to
remove these.  (This script makes use of
https://github.com/bplank/ud-conversion-tools, and replaces the original file)

## Training on multiple datasets

There are two methods to train on multiple datasets, one is to pass multiple
dataset configurations to `--dataset_configs`. Another method is to define
multiple dataset configurations in one jsonnet file. For example, if we want to
do supertagging (from the PMB), jointly with XPOS tags (from the UD) and RTE
(Glue), the config file would look as follows:

```
{
    "UD": {
        "train_data_path": "ewt.train",
        "validation_data_path": "ewt.dev",
        "word_idx": 1,
        "tasks": {
            "upos": {
                "task_type": "seq",
                "column_idx": 3
            }
        }
    },
    "PMB": {
        "train_data_path": "pmb.train",
        "validation_data_path": "pmb.dev",
        "word_idx": 0,
            "ccg": {
                "task_type": "seq",
                "column_idx": 3
            }
        }
    },
    "RTE": {
        "train_data_path": "data/glue/RTE.train",
        "validation_data_path": "data/glue/RTE.dev",
        "sent_idxs": [0,1],
        "tasks": {
            "rte": {
                "column_idx": 2,
                "task_type": "classification",
                "adaptive": true
            }
        }
    }
}
``` 

It should be noted that to do real multi-task learning, the tasks should have different names. For example, having two tasks with the name `upos` in two different datasets, will effectively lead to concatenating the data and threating it as one task. If they are instead named `upos_ewt` and `upos_gum`, then they will each have their own decoder.


## Prediction
For predicting on new data you can use `predict.py`, and provide it with the
model-archive, input data, and an output path:

```
python3 predict.py logs/ewt/<DATE>/model.tar.gz data/twitter/dev.norm predictions/ewt.twitter.out --device 0
```

If training is done on multiple datasets, you have to define which dataset-tasks you want to predict (the model also assumes the same data format as this training data, see [--raw_text](docs/predict_raw.md) for information on how to predict on raw data)

```
python3 predict.py logs/ewt/<DATE>/model.tar.gz data/twitter/dev.norm predictions/ewt.twitter.out --dataset UD-EWT --device 0
```

The value of `--dataset` should match the specified dataset name in the dataset configuration.


## How to

Task types:

* [seq](docs/seq.md): standard sequence labeling.
* [string2string](docs/string2string.md): same as sequence labeling, but learns a conversion from the original word to the instance, and uses that as label (useful for lemmatization). 
* [seq_bio](docs/seq_bio.md): a masked CRF decoder enforcing complying with the BIO-scheme.
* [multiseq](docs/multiseq.md): sequence labeling when the number of labels for each instance is not known in advance.
* [dependency](docs/dependency.md): dependency parsing.
* [classification](docs/classification.md): sentence classification, predicts a label for N utterances of text.
* [regression](docs/regression.md): predicts real (floating point) numbers on the sentence level.
* [probdistr](docs/probdistr.md): predict a distribution of labels on the sentence level.
* [mlm](docs/mlm.md): masked language modeling.
* [seq2seq](docs/seq2seq.md): sequence to sequence generation (e.g. machine translation).

## FAQ
If your question is not mentioned here, you can contact us on slack: https://join.slack.com/t/machamp-workspace/shared_invite/zt-piuoliwh-KaGJUwanucKKprx9IObJ6A

Q: How can I easily compare my own amazing parser to your scores on UD version X?  
A: Check the [results page](docs/results.md)

Q: Performance seems low, how can I double check if everything runs correctly?  
A: see the test folder, practically, you should be able to run `./test/runAll.sh` and all output of `check.py` should be green .

Q: It doesn't run for UD data?  
A: we do not support enhanced dependencies (yet), which means you have to remove some special annotations, for which you can use `scripts/misc/cleanconl.py`

Q: Memory usage is too high, how can I reduce this?  
A: Most setups should run on 12GB gpu memory. However, depending on the task-type, pre-trained embeddings and training data, it might require up to 20GB.
To reduce data usage, you could try:

* Use smaller embeddings
* smaller `batch_size` or `max_len` in your parameters config
* use our old version based on Allennlp 0.9; it needs slightly less memory, but has less funcionality. 
* Run on CPU (`--device -1`), which is actually only 4-10 times slower.

Q: Why don't you support automatic dataset loading?  
A: The first author thinks this would discourage/complexify looking at the actual data, which is important (https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur/status/1391657602900180993).

Q: How can I predict on the test set automatically after training?  
A: You can't, because the first author thinks you shouldn't, this would automatically lead to overfitting/overusing of the test data. You have to manually run predict.py after training to get predictions on the test data.

Q: what should I cite?
